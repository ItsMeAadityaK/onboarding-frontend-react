The conflict is caused as there was a different word in both files in different branches(main , conflict) and the git cant decide which one to keep while merging.
I resolved by keeping by editing the file to keep both words in the line and the merge was done successfully.
I learned that if i work on different branches and if i edit one one branch it wont get easily copy in different as well it will require my permission for that.

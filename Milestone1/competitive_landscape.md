1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
- Focus Bear stands out by combining productivity with wellness. Unlike apps like Freedom or Cold Turkey, which primarily block distractions, Focus Bear encourages healthy habits (like stretching or journaling) between deep work sessions. This blend of digital focus and personal well-being is unique and holistic.

2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
- As a user, I’d choose Focus Bear because it doesn’t just aim to boost productivity—it also supports building consistent routines. The structured environment with built-in breaks helps prevent burnout, which many other apps don’t address directly.

3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
- Apps like Routinery offer rich visual timelines and behavior tracking with streaks and motivational analytics. Focus Bear could benefit from more detailed progress tracking or gamified feedback to keep users engaged and accountable long-term.

4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
- Focus Bear could improve its user interface and add more personalization. For example, giving users more flexibility to customize their break activities or themes—similar to Tiimo’s highly personalized planner—might make it feel less rigid and more user-friendly.

Focus Bear was created to solve the problem of ADHD which is common in days for uni students and who face the problem of getting distracted easily.
Focus Bear is solving the issue of increasing the productivity by blocking down Apps or websites which can be distractful to people.
This mission is important because its solving a real world problem of getting our working days sorted.
Focus Bear will help me get rid of my distractions while i am on web and I am focused on working on something. It will just block those sites and wont let me use it.
Yes I personally relate to the issue as I have seen people having distraction problems so I will personally recommend them this.

Pull Requests (PRs) are important because they allow team members to review each other’s code before it gets merged into the main branch. This helps catch bugs, maintain consistent code quality, and make sure everyone is aware of the changes being made. It also creates a space for feedback, discussion, and collaboration.
A good PR is clear and focused on one specific change or feature. It should have a meaningful title, a short description explaining what was done and why, and link to any related issue if needed. A well-structured PR makes it easier for reviewers to understand the purpose of the change and give useful feedback.
I looked at a few open-source PRs and saw how both contributors and bots were involved in the discussion. People were giving feedback, pointing out issues or conflicts, and asking questions before anything got merged. I also noticed that tests were automatically run to make sure the changes didn’t break anything. It showed me how open-source projects maintain quality by using PRs as a checkpoint for review, testing, and teamwork.

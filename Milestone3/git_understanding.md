Pull Requests (PRs) are important because they allow team members to review each other’s code before it gets merged into the main branch. This helps catch bugs, maintain consistent code quality, and make sure everyone is aware of the changes being made. It also creates a space for feedback, discussion, and collaboration.
A good PR is clear and focused on one specific change or feature. It should have a meaningful title, a short description explaining what was done and why, and link to any related issue if needed. A well-structured PR makes it easier for reviewers to understand the purpose of the change and give useful feedback.
I looked at a few open-source PRs and saw how both contributors and bots were involved in the discussion. People were giving feedback, pointing out issues or conflicts, and asking questions before anything got merged. I also noticed that tests were automatically run to make sure the changes didn’t break anything. It showed me how open-source projects maintain quality by using PRs as a checkpoint for review, testing, and teamwork.

Staging is like preparing your work — you’re telling Git which specific changes you want to include in your next commit. Committing is the actual step that records those changes into the repository history. Until you commit, staged files are just set aside, not saved.
Git separates staging and committing to give developers more control. Sometimes you don’t want to commit everything you've changed — maybe you're working on two different features or fixed a bug while doing something else. Staging lets you choose exactly what goes into the commit so your history stays clean and organized.
This is useful when you're in the middle of something but want to save part of your progress. You might also use staging to carefully review what you're about to commit, especially in team projects where every commit matters. It also helps when breaking big changes into smaller, focused commits.

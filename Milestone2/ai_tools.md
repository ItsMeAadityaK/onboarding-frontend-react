1. I gave GitHub Copilot a go in VS Code and also used ChatGPT to help with a few coding questions and debugging.

2.  ChatGPT was great for explaining things I wasn’t 100% sure about and for figuring out small bugs.
The only downside was that sometimes ChatGpt would suggest code that didn’t really fit what I was doing. It’s good, but you still have to read through and make sure the logic makes sense.

3. I think AI tools are most helpful when I’m stuck or when I need to write something repetitive. They're also great for learning new things or getting a quick second opinion without digging through docs for hours.

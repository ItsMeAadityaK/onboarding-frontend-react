The multi-cursor ones (Alt + Click, Ctrl + D) are game-changers. Also, Ctrl + P and Ctrl + Tab make jumping between files super quick. These will definitely save me a ton of time during regular coding.

Using keyboard shortcuts helps me stay in the zone without breaking focus to grab the mouse every few seconds. It makes it way faster to do things I repeat all the time, like switching files or editing lines. Once you get used to them, they just become second nature and really make coding feel smoother and more efficient.

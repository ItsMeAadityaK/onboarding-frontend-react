1. I’m using Windows Terminal because it’s modern, clean, and works well with multiple shells like PowerShell, Command Prompt. It’s also really customizable and looks much better than the old default terminal.
2. I have kept the default theme as for now but i have tried all the customisations but didnt suit me well.
3. The most useful one was cd .. — I already knew about it, but I didn’t realize how powerful basic navigation could be when combined with ls, mkdir, and touch (or New-Item in PowerShell). It's really sped up how I move around and set up folders quickly.

I installed the following Chrome extensions to help with web development:
1. React Developer Tools – to inspect React components and see props and state easily.
2. Redux DevTools – useful for checking Redux state and tracking actions.
3. JSON Viewer – makes API responses easier to read in the browser.
4. Lighthouse – helps audit the performance and accessibility of web apps.

Redux DevTools made it super easy to track state changes and understand how the app responds to different actions. It saved a lot of time during debugging.

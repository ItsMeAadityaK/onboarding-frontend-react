In my example, I noticed a few small code smells: the function and variable names were shortened and unclear, there was an unnecessary commented-out line from an older version, and the password was a hardcoded magic string. I fixed these by using proper naming like loginUser, removing the unused comment, and replacing the hardcoded password with a constant. These changes made the code easier to read and more reliable. If I ever want to update the password, I only need to change it in one place. Small cleanups like this really help avoid confusion and reduce bugs later on.

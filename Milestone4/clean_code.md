1. Simplicity
Keep your code as straightforward as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on clear, direct solutions. Simple code is easier to read, test, and maintain.

2. Readability
Write code that others (and future you) can easily understand. Use meaningful variable and function names, and structure your code to be self-explanatory.

3. Maintainability
Organize your code so that it's easy to update and extend. Well-structured code allows future developers to make changes without introducing bugs.

4. Consistency
Stick to a consistent coding style throughout your project. This includes naming conventions, indentation, and file organization. Consistency makes your codebase more predictable and easier to navigate.

5. Efficiency
Write code that performs well, but don't over-optimize prematurely. Focus on writing clean and efficient code, and optimize when necessary based on actual performance needs.


If we take an example of def calc(x,y):return x+y
then the improved code will be 
def Calculate_sum(num1,num2)
    """Returns the sum of number 1 and number 2"""
    return num1 + num2

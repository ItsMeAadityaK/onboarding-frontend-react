CI/CD helps automate testing, formatting, and other checks so teams don’t have to manually verify every change. I set up GitHub Actions to run markdown linting and spell check on each pull request, and also added a Husky pre-commit hook to catch issues before code is pushed. Opening a test PR confirmed that the automated checks run correctly. This setup improves quality, saves time, and avoids errors slipping through. One challenge was making sure the workflow file was in the right folder — `.github/workflows/`. In small projects this setup is lightweight, but in large teams it can include automated testing, deployment, and code coverage checks too.

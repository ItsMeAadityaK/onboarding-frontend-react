1. What challenges did you face while setting up i18next?
One of the main challenges was dealing with package version conflicts during installation. I had to use the --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve dependency issues. Another small challenge was understanding the folder structure and where to place the translation logic so it loads properly across the app.

2. Why is it important to use a library like i18next instead of manually handling translations?
Using a library like i18next provides a scalable and efficient way to manage translations. Manually managing translations through conditionals or custom objects would quickly become messy, especially for large apps. i18next supports features like language detection, fallbacks, pluralization, and namespace management, which saves a lot of time and avoids bugs.

3. How would you handle dynamic content (e.g., user-generated text) in a multilingual app?
For dynamic content, I would store the user input as-is and avoid translating it automatically to preserve meaning. However, for any labels or system-generated prompts that appear alongside dynamic content, I would ensure theyâ€™re translated using i18next. If dynamic translations are needed, I would integrate with a translation API (like Google Translate) on the backend.

1. How does Formik simplify form management compared to handling state manually?
Formik abstracts much of the repetitive boilerplate needed for managing form state, change handlers, and submission logic. Instead of writing separate useState hooks for each input, Formik provides a clean useFormik hook that centralizes form values, change handlers, validation, and submit functions — making code more readable and easier to maintain.

2. What are the benefits of using Formik’s validation instead of writing validation logic manually?
Formik integrates smoothly with Yup, which allows us to define a concise validation schema. This schema-based approach avoids the need for writing multiple if conditions or manually tracking errors. It makes validations more declarative, consistent, and scalable — especially in larger forms.
